### Rules for Creating New Users and Departments

**General Principle:** A user can only create entities (users or departments) that fall *below* or *within* their scope of authority in the established hierarchy. They cannot create entities at or above their own level, nor outside their assigned departmental domain.

#### 1. Rules for Creating New Users

This addresses the "who can create whom" aspect, always ensuring the creator's role is superior or equal in its *administrative* capacity to the created user's intended role.

*   **System Administrator:**
    *   **Can Create:** Any user role (Senior Department Head, Department Head, Employee, or another System Administrator).
    *   **Can Assign to Department:** Any existing department, or a new department if they create it (see Department Creation rules).
    *   **Justification:** Full system control.

*   **Senior Department Head:**
    *   **Can Create:** Department Head, Employee.
    *   **Cannot Create:** System Administrator, another Senior Department Head.
    *   **Can Assign to Department:** Only to departments that fall *under their direct oversight* (i.e., departments they are responsible for).
    *   **Justification:** Manages within their defined domain; restricted from creating peer or superior roles.

*   **Department Head:**
    *   **Can Create:** Employee.
    *   **Cannot Create:** System Administrator, Senior Department Head, another Department Head.
    *   **Can Assign to Department:** Only to their *own specific department* or sub-departments they explicitly manage.
    *   **Justification:** Manages their immediate team; restricted to creating only the lowest-tier user role.

*   **Employee:**
    *   **Cannot Create:** Any user role.
    *   **Justification:** No administrative privileges for user management.

#### 2. Rules for Creating New Departments

This addresses the "who can create which organizational units" aspect.

*   **System Administrator:**
    *   **Can Create:** Any new top-level department.
    *   **Can Create:** Any new sub-department under an existing department.
    *   **Can Assign Owner:** Any user, including themselves, as the initial owner/head of the new department.
    *   **Justification:** Full system and organizational structure control.

*   **Senior Department Head:**
    *   **Can Create:** New sub-departments *only within their existing assigned department's hierarchy*. They cannot create new top-level departments.
    *   **Can Assign Owner:** A user *from within their own departmental scope* (i.e., a Department Head or another Senior Department Head within their domain).
    *   **Justification:** Manages and structures their departmental segment; cannot modify the top-level organizational structure.

*   **Department Head:**
    *   **Can Create:** Cannot create entirely new departments. (This is a more restrictive but secure approach. Often, sub-departments are created by a Sr. Dept Head or Admin, then managed by a Dept Head).
    *   **Alternative (if allowed, less restrictive):** Could potentially create a *sub-unit or team* within their direct department, but this would typically be represented as a *folder* structure or a *user group*, not a formal "department" in the administrative sense. For simplicity and security, we'll stick to **Cannot create.**
    *   **Justification:** Focuses on managing existing teams and documents, not redefining organizational structure.

*   **Employee:**
    *   **Cannot Create:** Any new departments.
    *   **Justification:** No administrative privileges for organizational structure management.
